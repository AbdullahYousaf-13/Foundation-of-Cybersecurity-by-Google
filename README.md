### Keep organizations secure

**Analytical thinking**
Security analysts often use analytical thinking, which means to think carefully and thoroughly. Analysts use this skill when monitoring and securing computer and network systems, responding to potential threats, defining system privileges, and determining ways to mitigate risk.

**Collaboration**
Collaboration means working with stakeholders and other team members. Security analysts often use this skill when responding to an active threat. They'll work with others when blocking unauthorized access and ensuring any compromised systems are restored.

**Malware prevention**
When a specific threat or vulnerability is identified, an analyst might install prevention software, which is software that works to proactively prevent a threat from occurring. Because malware is designed to harm devices or networks, malware prevention is essential.

**Communication**
As an analyst prevents and encounters threats, risks, or vulnerabilities, they document and report findings. A report might detail attempts to secure systems, test weak points, or offer solutions for system improvement. When reporting findings, strong communication skills are important.

**Understanding programming languages**
Analysts may sometimes work with software development teams to analyze and support security, install software, and set up appropriate processes. When involved with software development projects, it can be helpful for an analyst to understand programming languages.

**Using SIEM tools**
When security analysts need to review vulnerabilities, they conduct a periodic security audit. This is a review of an organization’s records, activities, and related documents. During audits, Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools help analysts better understand security threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

Advanced persistent threats (APTs) have significant expertise accessing an organization's network without authorization. APTs tend to research their targets (e.g., large corporations or government entities)  in advance and can remain undetected for an extended period of time. Their intentions and motivations can include:

- Damaging critical infrastructure, such as the power grid and natural resources

- Gaining access to intellectual property, such as trade secrets or patents

---

#### Hackers

A hacker is any person who uses computers to gain access to computer systems, networks, or data. They can be beginner or advanced technology professionals who use their skills for a variety of reasons. There are three main categories of hackers:

**Authorized hackers** 

These are also called ethical hackers. They follow a code of ethics and adhere to the law to conduct organizational risk evaluations. They are motivated to safeguard people and organizations from malicious threat actors.

**Semi-authorized hackers** 

These are considered researchers. They search for vulnerabilities but don’t take advantage of the vulnerabilities they find.

**Unauthorized hackers**

These are also called unethical hackers. They are malicious threat actors who do not follow or respect the law. Their goal is to collect and sell confidential data for financial gain. 

**Note:** There are multiple hacker types that fall into one or more of these three categories.

New and unskilled threat actors have various goals, including: 

To learn and enhance their hacking skills

To seek revenge

To exploit security weaknesses by using existing malware, programming scripts, and other tactics 

#### Types

**White Hat Hackers:** Ethical hackers who legally test and improve security systems.

**Black Hat Hackers:** Malicious hackers who exploit systems for personal or financial gain.

**Gray Hat Hackers:** Operate between ethical and malicious hacking, often without explicit permission.

**Script Kiddies:** Inexperienced hackers who use pre-made tools to attack systems.

**Hacktivists:** Hackers driven by political or social causes to disrupt or expose targets.

**State-Sponsored Hackers:** Government-backed hackers conducting cyber espionage or attacks.

**Cyber Terrorists:** Hackers who cause fear and large-scale disruption for ideological goals.
